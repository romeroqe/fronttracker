FrontTracker is a Python library for the segmentation, and analysis of oceanic fronts from satellite and reanalysis datasets. It integrates clustering, skeletonization, statistical and geometric analysis to provide robust descriptors of frontal structures, including position, intensity, orientation, eccentricity, and temporal evolution.

This methodology is suitable for both global and regional studies, enabling the monitoring of frontal dynamics, lifecycle events (formation, enhancement, splitting, merging, attenuation, and decay), and links with biogeochemical processes.

## ✨ Features
- Segmentation and skeletonization of frontal lines.  
- Extraction of geometric descriptors (length, width, eccentricity).  
- Statistical metrics from pixel distribution (kurtosis, skewness).  
- Tracking of fronts through time based on spatial overlap.  
- Compatible with satellite, model, and reanalysis data.  


## Installation
To use this methodology install it with:
```bash
pip install fronttracker
```

## Documentation

Full documentation and Jupyter demos are available in the [FrontTracker documentation page](https://romeroqe.github.io/fronttracker/).
